Game Imager is a program that reads and writes images used in games. In many games, the images
are not a standard format, so you can't use a normal image editing program to change them. So,
with the assistance of Game Imager, you are able to convert these game images into different
formats, or just view them in the program.

For further information, downloads, and help, visit the website at http://www.watto.org/imager
