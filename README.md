## About Game Imager
Game Imager is a program that reads and writes images used in games. In many games, the images
are not a standard format, so you can't use a normal image editing program to change them. So,
with the assistance of Game Imager, you are able to convert these game images into different
formats, or just view them in the program.

PLEASE NOTE: Game Extractor is a much newer and continuously-maintained product that supports
all the formats in Game Imager (as well as many more image formats). We strongly recommend
using Game Extractor in preference to Game Imager, for this reason.
